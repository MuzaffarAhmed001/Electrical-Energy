Predicting Electrical Energy Output (EP) of a Combined Cycle Power Plant using Artificial Neural Network. Features consist of hourly average ambient variables Temperature (T), Ambient Pressure (AP), Relative Humidity (RH) and Exhaust Vacuum (V) to predict the net hourly electrical energy output (EP) of the plant.Features consist of hourly average ambient variables - Temperature (T) in the range 1.81°C and 37.11°C, - Ambient Pressure (AP) in the range 992.89-1033.30 milibar, - Relative Humidity (RH) in the range 25.56% to 100.16% - Exhaust Vacuum (V) in teh range 25.36-81.56 cm Hg - Net hourly electrical energy output (EP) 420.26-495.76 MW
